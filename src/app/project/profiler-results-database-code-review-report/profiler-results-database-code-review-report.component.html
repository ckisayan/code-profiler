      <h2>Key Findings</h2>
      <div class="finding">
        <h3>Finding 1: Missing Index on Frequently Queried Columns</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Some tables lack indexes on columns that are frequently queried, leading to potential performance degradation.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This may result in slower query execution, especially on large datasets.</p>
        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Create indexes on the columns that are frequently used in WHERE and JOIN conditions.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="finding">
        <h3>Finding 2: Use of Deprecated SQL Functions</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Some SQL queries use deprecated functions which are no longer supported in the latest versions of the database engine.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This could lead to errors during future upgrades or patches.</p>
        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Replace deprecated functions with their current alternatives as per the latest documentation.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="finding">
        <h3>Finding 3: Lack of Proper Transaction Handling</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> There are database operations that do not use proper transaction management, which can lead to data inconsistencies.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This can result in partial updates and inconsistencies in data integrity.</p>
        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Ensure all data modification operations are wrapped in appropriate transactions, with proper commit/rollback logic.</p>
